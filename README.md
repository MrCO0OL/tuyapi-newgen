# tuyapi-newgen
 updated Tuya API library to keep up with Tuya updates

A library for communicating with devices that use the [Tuya](http://tuya.com) cloud network. These devices are branded under many different names, but if your device works with the TuyaSmart app or port 6668 is open on your device chances are this library will work for you.
This is new fork from tuyapi to revive the project and add new Tuya API versions and features.
